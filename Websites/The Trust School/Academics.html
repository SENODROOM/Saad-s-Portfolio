                            Exhaustive
                            evaluation and improvements are made year after year to keep the curriculum dynamic. All out

                            requirements
                            of the curriculum. While selecting textbooks we generally keep in mind the student learning
                            outcomes given in the National Curriculum 2006. The Schools are affiliated with the
                            respective
                            Board of intermediate and Secondary Education. The Curriculum for different classes is

                            The First Educational step that a child takes at an impressionable age of four is in Nursery and then on to Prep. Bearing in mind that the foundation of a child personality is laid and two third of his/her intellect formed at this age, we have created an environment and system of teaching which is entirely Child friendly. The students of these Classes are housed in a separate Block with their own work area, play-area and well equipped activity room. Formal learning of the three R’s is introduced in Nursery. It finds a more prominent place in the Prep Curriculum, when the child is five. Recognition, reading and writing of Urdu and English alphabet and small words are then introduced. Basic arithmetic concepts are also introduced here.

                            The basic concepts that a child was introduced to the Preschool take a more firm footing here and the syllabus becomes more Broad-based. The Young learner is gradually exposed to subjects like Urdu, English, Mathematics, General science and Social Studies besides teaching of Islamiyat & Naazra Quran. Efforts are made to make teaching communicative and Interactive to encourage student’s participation.
